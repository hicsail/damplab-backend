# DampLab Backend Scripts

## Introduction

These scripts are intended for development purpose and thus are expected to
change rapidly. The scripts are used as tools to make testing in development
easier. They complete tasks such as clearing out the database, loaded different
pieces of data into the database, adding pieces of data manually, etc.

> :warning:
> 1. Do not treat these scripts as stable
> 2. The scripts do not follow the same constraints as the rest of the code
>    base and therefore developers should not rely on the safety of the types
>    being added into the database
> 3. The scripts are not guaranteed to be kept up-to-date with the rest of
>    the code base.
